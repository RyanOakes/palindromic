Assignment  Python Fundamentals
Palindromic
Write a program that asks the user for one or more sentences and then lets the user know if it is a palindrome.
Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should...

Understand how to manipulate strings
Understand how strings are related to lists
Understand recursion
Be able to strip characters out of strings
Be able to change the case of strings
Be able to look at substrings
Be able to add, commit, and push to GitHub
Deliverables
A GitHub repo named palindromic containing at least:
A README.md file with a good description of the problem being solved.
A Python file named palindrome.py that contains your implementation.
A Python file named palindrome_test.py that contains the provided tests.
After your work is complete, make sure to git push your changes up to GitHub. It's a good habit to do this more than once along the way as you're making progress.

Use the homework submission form on the course website to turn in a link to your GitHub repository.

Normal Mode
Your goal for tonight is to write a program that, when run, asks the user to input some text. It can be a phrase, a sentence, or multiple sentences. After it is entered, your program will let the user know if it is a palindrome or not by printing "is a palindrome" or "is not a palindrome" in the output.

Letter casing and punctuation do not matter when testing a palindrome. All of the following are valid palindromes:

Lisa Bonet ate no basil.
A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal: Panama!
Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
Requirements
Write your main() function to ask the user for a word/sentence, pass it into the is_palindrome function, and state whether or not the the sentence is palindromic.
Write your is_palindrome function using recursion.
Your program must pass all of the tests provided in palindrome_test.py. You should be able to run this with python palindrome_test.py.
You need a function named is_palindrome that takes a string and returns a boolean (True or False). Your program must use this function.
Advanced Mode (optional)
Complete all of the requirements of Normal Mode.
Make an iterative version of your is_palindrome function (using loops instead of recursion), and ensure it passes the tests too.
Notes
You may want to use the re.sub function to strip out punctuation and spaces. A regular expression pattern you can use to match all non-alphabetical characters is r'[^A-Za-z]'.

Additional Resources
